# kak.el
An attempt to port Kakoune's multiple selections into Emacs

This package provides functions that simulate Kakoune's multi-selection commands.
It is built on top of [`evil-mc`](https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc)'s multiple cursors and [`evil`](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)'s functions.
